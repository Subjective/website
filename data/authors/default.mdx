Hey there! I'm Josh, a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Washington. My technical interests lie in artificial intelligence, systems, and cybersecurity, with a focus on resilient and intelligent software that adapts to complex challenges.

I'm passionate about interdisciplinary research and enjoy tackling real-world problems through innovative solutions. Currently, I'm an undergraduate researcher at UW's [Programmable Matter Lab](https://www.programmablematterlab.com/), where I develop generative design and fabrication tools to enable on-demand, adaptable manufacturing. I also have industry experience from my internship at Amazon, where I worked on AI-driven developer tools.

When I'm not hitting the books, I love competing in hackathons, reading light novels, hiking, and building mechanical keyboards.

If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email. I'll get back to you as soon as I can!
