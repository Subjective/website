Hey there! My name is Josh, and I am an incoming CS student at the University of Washington. I am especially interested in fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cybersecurity. I'm passionate about interdisciplinary research and enjoy exploring innovative solutions to real-world problems. 

When I'm not hitting the books, I love competing in hackathons, reading light novels, hiking, and building mechanical keyboards.

If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email. I'll get back to you as soon as I can!
